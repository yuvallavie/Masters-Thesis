A Gaussian process is a stochastic process such that every finite collection
of random variables derived from the process has a multivariate normal
distribution. These processes are extremely useful in practice and are used
as basis for many novel machine learning techniques and time series prediction models. We focus our attention on Centered Stationary Gaussian
Processes with continuous paths (CSGP) and look for algorithms which
estimate small and large deviations within a valid and practical precision.
In this thesis we tackle the challenge of estimating rare events by presenting contemporary methods of estimation and proposing new estimation
and simulation methods.
